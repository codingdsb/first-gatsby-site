# My First Gatsby Site

This gatsby site was built by me by following the React Gatsby Tutorial on the official website of gatsby js...

To run the project locally, clone this repo, run `npm install` or `yarn` in the project directory. Delete the example articles in the blog folder and write your own articles in mdx files (saved in the blog folder) with the following format:

```markdown
---
title: "title of my post"
date: "yyyy-mm-dd"
---

# The content of your blog post goes here.....

> some block quotes  
> `some inline code`
> etc....
```

Finally run the commmand:

```bash
npm run develop # for npm users
yarn develop # for yarn users
gatsby develop # if you have gatsby cli installed
```
